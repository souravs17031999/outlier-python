# Algorithm :    

### Getting started Locally :  
> Run On Terminal       
  

> Run In IDLE   


> Run on Jupyter   
Open terminal (cmd)   
```jupyter notebook```   
Create a new python3 file.     


* ```topsis_main()``` has been specifically designed to inhibit leakeage of inbuilt functions.  
* ```topsis_main(debug=True)``` use this to display all the intermediate matrices.   
* Make sure that ```filename.csv``` is in same directory where package is installed.

### OUTPUT :
Removes all the valid rows contaning outlier values from the dataset and prints the number of rows removed along with the columns which were considered for the algorithm.    
 

# TESTING : 
* The package has been extensively tested on various datasets consisting varied types of expected and unexpected input data and any preprocessing , if required has been taken care of.
